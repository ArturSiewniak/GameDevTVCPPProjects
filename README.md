This repository contains most of my project files from GameDev.tv Unreal 4.22 C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games online training program

Projects include:
-Triple X
-Building Escape
-Bull Cow Game
-Toon Tanks
(-Simple Shooter) <- I will mention it below

Each of the folders contain bare minimum required to build the project in Unreal Engine versions 4.22 and up (I recommend building them in 4.25 as I rebuilt them all using 4.25.4 without problems). Each folder has a "CONTROLS.txt" with a brief explanation of controls and in some a goal in a demo.

Due to GitHubs constraints with file sizes I am unable to upload project files for the Simple Shooter which was featured in the course due to the size of the assets. Same goes for all of the projects builds as even with all packaging options centered around lowering build size (Project/Packaging settings: Build configuration->Shipping; Full Rebuild->true; For Distribution->true; Cook everyhing in the project content directory->true; Cook only maps->true) it's simply not possible to upload ready builds.

If needed I can send missing build/projects via some host service.
